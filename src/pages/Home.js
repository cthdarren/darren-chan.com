            I love tech and I surround myself with it. To me, creating software is like inventing new inventions in the 1600s, being able
            to create something out of nothing just satisifies an itch in my brain somewhere.
            <br/>
            Being able to use software in order to make things move in real life, and being able to 
            interact with it is even cooler, which is why I have recently started to work with many IoT devices in my home.
            <br/>
            Software wise, I have also recently picked up game development and I am in love with it; Another form of the creation itch being scratched.
