            As a passionate software developer, I have a strong love for
            customisation. I love customising my websites, my environment, my
            keyboard, the list goes on.
            <br />
            <br /> My programming journey began in 2017. I had begun taking a
            cybersecurity diploma because I thought hacking was cool
            at the time. <br />
            <br />
            As it turns out, hacking <i>is</i> pretty cool, but it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for. <br /> <br />
            During that time, my love for programming blossomed, and I haven't grown
            tired of it since.
