            As a passionate software developer, I have a strong love for customisation. I love customising my websites, my environment, my keyboard, name it all!<br/><br/> In 2017, I took a cybersecurity diploma because I thought hacking was cool. <br/><br />As it turns out, hacking <i>is</i> pretty cool, but the theory is pretty dry, and I figured it wasn't for me. <br /> <br/>During that time, my love for programming blossomed, and I haven't grown tired of it since.
